title: Portable MP3 Player
description: I designed the full schematic for a portable MP3 player using an ESP32-WROOM, building the entire system from scratch. This included selecting and connecting components like the VS1053 decoder, TP4056 battery charger, MP1584 buck converter, and an OLED display. I integrated multiple input methods including a rotary encoder, joystick, and tactile switches, and accounted for power regulation, USB-C charging with CC logic, and ESD protection. The design also features an SD card module for storage. All connections, passive components, and protection circuitry were planned out and finalized in a complete schematic using KiCad.
